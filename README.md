Project Description (250 words max):

This project provides a safe space for Mindfulness and Emotional Regulation. Originally, it was conceived as a self-injury prevention tool. Indeed, self-harm urges are intense and fuelled by the surrounding environment. Providing a Virtual Environment allows the participant to escape the triggering space fully.

The user arrives in a calming environment. This is ensured by using mellow colors, nature imagery and relaxing sounds. They are welcomed and prompted to choose a color which represents their mood. Then, the emotion stays with them for a bit and fades away.  This is aligned with DBT. Recognizing one's emotions and accepting them, or "Riding the Wave" helps patients tolerate their distress.

After this, the user can roam freely in the space. Sounds of birds, wind, and leaves are in different spots for the user to explore. This aligns with the DBT practice of mindfulness. By focusing on distinct sounds and observing, the user may become calmer and more aware of their body.

Although it was conceived for self-harm prevention, this can be a tool for subjects suffering from any type of emotional distress. Our virtual environment has the potential to improve well-being by helping users escape triggering situations, identify emotions and be mindful.

As well, it can be a tool for scientific exploration. Indeed, scientists can access live data about: mental states of distress, DBT effectiveness, the processes of emotional regulation. This could improve therapy techniques significantly. It could also allow us to understand neural mechanisms of self-injury urges or other distressing situations.
